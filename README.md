# Final-Year-University-Project
## Overview
My final year university project around collecting a dataset, importing it into Python, using Pandas to clean and manipulate the dataset, and plotting the results via Seaborn. The data collected was video game reviews on the top 5 rated games per year from 2000 to 2021, and for each, an arbitrary score was calculated from the innovation of each game in Story, and the innovation in Gameplay mechanics. Using these two scores, a final calculation could be made to determine how innovative a games' story was, and how it changes over time alongside innovations in gameplay.

## Project Goals
The goals of this project were to perform an in-depth analysis of the dataset that I had collected, to determine whether my hypothesis that games were becoming more innovative in story was true, as well as experimenting, and learning how to use different Python libraries for data analysis and investigation. This was all bundled together alongside my program as a final deliverable for my university project, to demonstrate that I could set out on a target and complete a report detailing it.

## Tools and Technologies used
### Python
- Functions
- Loops
- Text-based GUI
- Exporting code as an .exe program
### Pandas
- Creating dataframes
- Calculations on dataframes
- Manipulating data
### Seaborn
- Creating loops to draw graphs
- Experimenting with different visualizations

## Strong Points of my Work
- Gathering a complete dataset for analysis
- Providing critical analysis of specific video games to prove my hypothesis
- Analysing the data set and determing a conclusion from it via an in-depth discussion
- Easy to use GUI for users to use
- Scalable program that theoretically could work for any data project that needs to combine two columns into one value via the same formula

## Repo Sections
- Final report
- Program.exe, Python code file, and Data Set as a .csv
- Images included in the report alongside an excel file for the data
